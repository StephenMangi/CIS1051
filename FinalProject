## Hello, the link for my Final Project is below:

## In this project, I didn't have to use a python script to solve the issue. I found a much easier way to accomplish this problem

'''
The problem at hand were errors being made by employees that were causing more work on the end of our administration team. 
The errors were coming in through customer PO's and making the internal orders team duplicate work. This could be prevented by making the field
automated and not user determinable. This information is stored in apptivo (NSI's CRM) and could be used appropriately. 
I thought I would have to use a webhook out of the CRM to a code hosting server in order to get this done. After digging into the Apptivo's API,
I realized I could use information that is already stored in the CRM. I created an attribute that references the principle relationship to assign
the PDF template to the principle's relationship.
