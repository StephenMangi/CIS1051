## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

The company I work for uses an cloud based CRM. in this CRM, we have principals(companies that we represent) and they have 1 of 2 relations with us. Either Buy/Resell or Transmittal. This is based on how the orders we get for their products gets handled. Currently, we have to manually choose this relationship. I Think it would be uber beneficial if the CRM could automatically assign this relationship when the principle is referenced.
