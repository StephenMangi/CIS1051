# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Principle relationship Assignment

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A python code that will integrate into our CRM at work, which will select what the order type is based on the principle. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The company I work for as an Engineer is called NSI. NSI uses a company called apptivo as it's CRM. It is a cloud based CRM and uses webhooks for automating editable fields. I would like to automate one step for my company as it would be one step that positively benefits me and my department. From apptivo, I would use a webhook to get the field I need out to the code. When the code is ran that returns the relationship to the principle, it will then be prompted to send the code back to the CRM.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Single Player

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will definitely learn how about API's and web hooks. I will definitely write the python program that chooses what the relationship is based on input. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be for it to be functioning and implemented at NSI. The webhook reaches out to the code and the software receives the correct relationship from the python code.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The main skills I will need to acquire are webhooks, API's, and JSON. the CRM uses JSON for it's background software. The CRM limits the amount of automation that you can use, so the webhooks and python will help to work around the limitations. I will still need to use JSON to use the webhooks. The API learning would be very minimal as I would only need to know how to use the API for Apptivo. Working in it every day of the week helps, but I rarely see more than what is inside my window.
